PROCEDURE I USED FOR AUTOMATING AMAZON WEBSITE FOR TESTING :-
              
                 
                 1. CREATED TEST CASES USING AUTOMATED WEB RECORD AND PLAY AND SOMEPART OF IT IN MANUAL CREATION
                 2.CONVERTED THEM INTO TEST SUITES
                 3.COMBINED TEST SUITES INTO TEST SUITE COLLECTION
                 4.CROSS BROWSER TESTING :- CHOOSEN DIFFERENT HOSTING WEBSITES THAT INCLUDE CHROME AND MMICROSOFT EDGE AND RUN ALL THE TEST SUITES AT ONCE IN PARALLEL OR SEQUENTIAL WINDOWS AT DIFFERENT OCCURANCE.
                 5. CREATED TEST LISTNERS TO REDUCE CODE COMPLEXITY AND TIME COPLEXITY AND ADDED TEST LISTNERS TO ALL TEST CASES AND TEST SUITES.
                 6.CREATED CHECKBOXES FOR  CHECKING SOME ITEMS IN REFERENCE.
                 7.CREATED LOCAL AND GLOBAL VARIABLES 
                     a. FOR GLOBAL VARIABLES  WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT AT TOP RIGHT CORNER LEFT TO RUN BUTTON.
                     b. FOR LOCAL VARIABLES JUST WE CAN CREATE VARIABLES AT TEST CASES ITSELF BESIDE MANUAL AND SCRIPT BOTTOM OF THE CODE.
                 8.DONE DATA DRIVEN TESTING BY TAKING DATA FROM EXTERNAL EXCEL SHEEL AND CREATING VARIABLES AND ASSINGNING VALUES FROM EXCEL SHEET
                 9.HENCE ,GENERATED REPORTS AT TEST LISTNER LEVEL BY  DOING CROSS BROWSER TESTING.
